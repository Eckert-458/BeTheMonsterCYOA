            How did you end up here...? Souls do not ... come here. They can't.
          </p>
          <p>
            Human, you have to go to the lake...to Kur ... Else ... You don't know? 
            Bad, that's ... bad. Too long here and you'll be a prisoner. Like me...
          </p>
          <p>
            Quick! Run to the mountaintop. You don't deserve to be trapped here. No one ... does.
          </p>
          <p>
            No... It's too late now. Why would the trap you here? Just to ... hurt me ... ? 
            I'm so sorry ... this is my fault.
          </p>
          <p>
            But ... there's a choice. I could ... make you a new body. 
            With it, you'll be able to go above the not-sky, into their world.
            But ... humans ... I can't make them. It's forbidden.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now ... come to me. I'm a mother again. So ... happy.

                  Soon after the firstborn, the All-Mother gave birth to four more children. 
                  They were unlike all that came before and all that came after: devoid of will, form, and thought.
                  But in being born, they shackled the old chaos, giving birth to the world.<br /><br />
                  You hear one of their voices and your body is composed, at least in part, of one of the principles that was imposed on chaos: fire, water, earth, or wind.<br /><br />

              Sometimes, no dull thuds or loud buzzing announces the presence of a monster, but a sharp sound as the air splits with their steps.<br /><br />
              Your legs, stronger than any metal, can break through armor and rend flesh with ease.<br /><br />

              Each step you take somehow feels more wobbly, yet more solid than the last, for you no longer tread solely upon the physical.<br /><br />
              Felling the flow of magic on your feet lets you spend less power on your spells.<br /><br />

              In the very distant north, the heathen barbarians fear the proud falcons above all else, for their talons spell death to all.<br /><br />
              Without the tiniest effort, your claws split flesh, so sharp they are that the air whistles when it touches them.<br /><br />

              Muscled legs ending on a flat surface grant you great kinging power, and the possibility of trampling your enemies.<br /><br />

              In the old chaos there was no difference between the physical and the ethereal, between thought and action, between will and power.<br /><br />

              There has been much discussion about what magic really is at its very core.<br /><br />
              Some say a spell is communication, that they call and something obeys.<br /><br />
              Others, that it is simply the soul overcoming reality, citing the strange powers of some monsters.<br /><br />

              An undeniable advantage that monsters have over humans is their speed.<br /><br />
              What takes ten days of travel for a human army, a centaur warband crosses in six.<br /><br />
              Boats cannot outpace the gullet of the giant serpents that give chase.<br /><br />

              When fire was born, the endless possibilities of chaos were burnt away, leaving only what could be.<br /><br />
              Fire prefers to manifest in great bursts of destruction, but can appear in weaker forms if that suits your needs.<br /><br />
              Explosions and conflagrations, hearth fires and candlelight, all forms of fire attend your call.<br /><br />

              With the birth of water an unbreakable bulwark pushed down chaos, and thus change became possible.<br /><br />
              Water cares not for how it manifests; in motion it is as a spear, in calm it is as a shield.<br /><br />
              Be they currents that rip apart ships, endless deluges, or gentle waves, all waters are part of you.<br /><br />

              At earth’s birth, the foundations of life were build atop water, and so were the walls that chaos could not cross.<br /><br />
              Earth resists change, but to be of any use it must move.<br /><br />
              Spires of metal pierce your enemies, walls of stone shelter from harm, all at the instant you wish it so.<br /><br />

              Sometimes, water takes on the properties of earth, giving rise to ice.<br /><br />
              Monsters that control ice are rare, but far to the north, where they are most common, there are few beings more feared.<br /><br />
              For ice, stout as the earth, moves with the fluidity of water and the cold it leaves in its wake renders the land barren.<br /><br />

              When wind’s motion becomes fury, and thus becomes as fire, only then is lightning born.<br /><br />
              Lightning is the favored weapon of the gods, and often do endless bolts rain upon monsters that dare assault the temple-cities.<br /><br />
              Lightning moves faster than the winds, and strikes with more ferocity than fire.<br /><br />

              Magic has been man’s defense against his enemies since he sided with the gods.<br /><br />
              While the monsters attuned to the elements control the as one might a body part, mages are much more versatile, 
              their spells bring all elements to heel, though it might require catalysts or lengthy chants.<br />

              Much has been written of Enlil’s radiance, of how he blinded the monsters that threated to devour humanity, and lead his followers to safety and prosperity.<br /><br />
              What is not engraved in tablets is how some monsters are born with the same humbling radiance, their bodies warm to the touch and their voices commanding.<br /><br />
              Often these shining beings cannot bear other’s pain, and do all in their power to stop their suffering<br /><br />

              Your aura has grown in strength so much that it has begun to tread into the material realm.<br /><br />
              It can turn away enemy blows, and render the elements deaf to spells, and if you wish, rain upon enemies as searing bolts of light.<br /><br />
              So strong is your existence that you could weather the old chaos, your light keeping you safe from the uncaring tides of non-existence.<br /><br />

              In long lost days, monsters could form a pact, bonding their souls with the other and sharing their boundless strength.<br /><br />
              That art is now long lost, for in the age of the gods, companionship is but a weakness.<br /><br />
              You have recovered the pact, but will you be able to find someone worthy of it in this world?<br /><br />

              It seems your soul is truly from another place, and what remains of the days before the days harkens to you, in envy, love, and hatred.<br /><br />

              Your body now excretes poison, a full does of which is lethal to any being below your power.<br /><br />
              If you have a Stinger Tail, the venom it delivers has become so incredibly lethal that it can kill even beings with less than two more power than you.<br /><br />

              Some monsters prefer to simply wait for their prey to come, instead of hunting for them.<br /><br />
              If you wish to join their ranks, this perk is essential, for it allows you to imitate the color and texture of everything you touch.<br /><br />

              Many have tried to force themselves beyond their limits using magic, and few have found success.<br /><br />
              You however, can claim more success than most, and for an amount of minutes equal to your power, you can boost all of your ability scores by +1.<br /><br />
              If you exceed that limit without having significant rest, your body will be damaged. Possibly enough to force you into a coma.<br /><br />

              It is rare, but some species of monsters possess a boundless vitality which, independently from their strength, closes their wounds at blistering speeds.<br /><br />
              Wounds disappear in seconds, and severed limbs take only minutes to regrow.<br /><br />

                The figure's rancid smell hits you, as you see the corpse.
              </p>
              <p>
                You raise your eyes and find another, and another, and another. So very many corpses. All brutalized beyond recognition.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before long, you find a destroyed ... village? Nest? There's so much damage you cannot tell.
              </p>
              <p>
                Is this what the gods do to those that defy them? Then they cannot be suffered to live.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rise, children of the All-Mother, and cast down the traitorous gods.

                The figue is a skeleton with plants using it as scaffolding.
              </p>
              <p>
                You understand. Death is required for new growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everything dies, and it is long past time for the world itself to do so. Humans, monsters, gods. All shall die, so there can be peace once more.
              </p>
              <p>
                You shall bring the end of the world, so it can be recast anew from primordial chaos.

                The figue introduces himself as Enki, one of the gods of this world.

              <p>
                Before you can react, he stabs towards you with a spear.
              </p>
              <p>
                The god tells you that he cannot bear to let another of his brothers and sisters die to a monster such as yourself.

              <p>
                You desperately fight to survive against him, as you process his words. Do you kill him? Can you kill him?

                Know that his conviction is such that he will never cease his hunt until only one of you remain.

                The figure is that of the All-Mother.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite the incredible distance you traveled, it seems you are right back where you started.
              </p>
              <p>
                You realize that despite what feels like a lot of time passing you haven't felt hunger, or thirst.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps staying and keeping the All-Mother company is an acceptable price for immortality.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are at peace.
